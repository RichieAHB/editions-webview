# Editions Webview

Currently, for the editions app, we build our article webviews on the fly. In future there should probably be some better tooling around this that allows us to run a nice little parcel build and throw our article data into the webview via injected JS. Until then, and while we're still concatenating strings, this gives a nice API around creating tagged components and adding non-global styles to them similar to `styled-components` and some naive `react` combined.

Feel free to never use this code or - if it ever gets used - rip it out when something better comes along. Hopefull the similarity to components will make porting it to a JSX type thing easier in future - but it may not.

Best place to look to understand this API is `./lib.ts` (there are lots of comments) and the associated test for it. Or just poke around in some of the components.
